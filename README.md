# Scope: Getting Started
A starter iOS/cocoapods project instrumented with [Scope](https://scope.undefinedlabs.com). It uses standard [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) fur building and testing.

This starter project is based on:
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

## Install Scope on Xcode projects with GitHub Actions

The project needs to add a new `ScopeAgent` pod to the Podfile, and run the tests

Finally, the build and test action has been configured in the GitHub Workflow `main.yml` file setting the user API key as a environment variable:

```yaml
name: Scope Testing

on: [push]

jobs:
  scope:
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Check if SCOPE_APIKEY is set
        run: if [ "${{secrets.SCOPE_APIKEY}}" = "" ]; then exit 1; fi
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Switch XCode Version
        run: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_11.app
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          pod update
          xcodebuild test -workspace scope-ios-cocoapods-starter.xcworkspace -scheme scope-ios-cocoapods-starter -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 11,OS=13.0' 
        env:
          SCOPE_APIKEY: ${{secrets.SCOPE_APIKEY}}
```
